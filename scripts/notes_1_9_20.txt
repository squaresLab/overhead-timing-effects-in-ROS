you got stuck working with create_mutations.py
you were tryring to make it so you could select whether to instrument at each individual site
but then you noticed that comby did this. and you want ed to know why
has it been fixed in a new release? should you report it to R?

-    // return immediately if EKF not used
+    // {sleep 0.500000; return immediately if EKF not used
     if (!ahrs.have_inertial_nav()) {
         return false;
     }

     // return immediately if neither optflow nor visual odometry is enabled
-    bool enabled = false;
+    bool enabled = false;}
 #if OPTFLOW == ENABLED
     if (optflow.enabled()) {
         enabled = true;

are you using the right parameters with the python bindings? does it know you're working in C++?
the relevant file is dskatz@gs12629:~/ardupilot/ArduCopter/system.diff.cpp
